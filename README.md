====================

Randomised Programming Quiz System
Provides a framework for testing Students by giving them a set of Randomised Quiz Questions based off an XML template defined by an educator.
Uses Active Directory for authentication and group membership.
Supports both C++ and Java for question testing.

The project was initially developed by Ben Evans for a Project for a Macquarie University Unit <http://www.mq.edu.au> in 2010.
It was designed to generate randomised questions for quizzes based on fundamental programming concepts in C++.
The initial proposal and motivation behind this program is outlined in initial_proposal.pdf

Since then, the project has been 'ported' (roughly) to the Zend Framework (2011/2012) and has also expanded to include Java Compatibility.
It is important to note that although the program has been refined since that time, it still has some pretty major security holes - use at your own risk! (would recommend a dedicated server)
